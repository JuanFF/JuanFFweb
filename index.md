Hello! My name is Juan, and my job is to develop artificial intelligence applications that understand the human language. This task is known as <b>Natural Language Processing</b> (NLP). Virtual assistants, search engines or machine translation systems are everyday examples of these applications. 

Artificial intelligence is not about pictures from robots or complex brain circuits. It is a path towards a better understanding of cognition and language as a mental faculty. To build truly smart applications, we need to grasp the complex nature of human beings that is mirrored by natural language.

In this site, you will find some <b>NLP and machine learning resources</b> I have been working on these years, especially in the healthcare domain.

My latest project is a <a href="Apps.html">bot</a> that retrieves headlines from Twitter with positive stories in the COVID-19 pandemic.

I currently live in Madrid, Spain.
